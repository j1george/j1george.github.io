    <p>The new “Avengers” movie has just been released! There are a lot of people at the cinema box office standing in a
        huge line. Each of them has a single <code>100</code>, <code>50</code> or <code>25</code> dollars bill. An
        “Avengers” ticket costs <code>25 dollars</code>.</p>
    <p>Vasya is currently working as a clerk. He wants to sell a ticket to every single person in this line.</p>
    <p>Can Vasya sell a ticket to each person and give the change if he initially has no money and sells the tickets
        strictly in the order people follow in the line?</p>
    <p>Return <code>YES</code>, if Vasya can sell a ticket to each person and give the change with the bills he has at
        hand at that moment. Otherwise return <code>NO</code>.</p>
